## Overview:

Scripts used to generate the figures, video, and datasets for the manuscript.

`make_all_plots.R` is used to generate figure panels in R and generate the source data file.

All *txt* files encode the commands used to visualize data on 3D structures using ChimeraX.

All *py* files used to generate svg figure formats.

All scripts are named according to the figure, video or datasets they generate. 

We also provide *png* files needed to compile several figure panels with this code.
